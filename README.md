## Overview
  This project was designed as a homework assignment for my coding bootcamp. The challenge was yo builf an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This project required the user of Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

  This application wasn't deployed, a walkthrough video was used to demonstrate its functionality.demo 1
